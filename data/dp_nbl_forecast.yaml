  UnitMultiplier:
    description: "The unit multipliers defined for the CIM.  When applied to unit\
      \ symbols, the unit symbol is treated as a derived unit. Regardless of the contents\
      \ of the unit symbol text, the unit symbol shall be treated as if it were a\
      \ single-character unit symbol. Unit symbols should not contain multipliers,\
      \ and it should be left to the multiplier to define the multiple for an entire\
      \ data type. \r\n\r\nFor example, if a unit symbol is \"m2Pers\" and the multiplier\
      \ is \"k\", then the value is k(m**2/s), and the multiplier applies to the entire\
      \ final value, not to any individual part of the value. This can be conceptualized\
      \ by substituting a derived unit symbol for the unit type. If one imagines that\
      \ the symbol \"\xDE\" represents the derived unit \"m2Pers\", then applying\
      \ the multiplier \"k\" can be conceptualized simply as \"k\xDE\".\r\n\r\nFor\
      \ example, the SI unit for mass is \"kg\" and not \"g\".  If the unit symbol\
      \ is defined as \"kg\", then the multiplier is applied to \"kg\" as a whole\
      \ and does not replace the \"k\" in front of the \"g\". In this case, the multiplier\
      \ of \"m\" would be used with the unit symbol of \"kg\" to represent one gram.\
      \  As a text string, this violates the instructions in IEC 80000-1. However,\
      \ because the unit symbol in CIM is treated as a derived unit instead of as\
      \ an SI unit, it makes more sense to conceptualize the \"kg\" as if it were\
      \ replaced by one of the proposed replacements for the SI mass symbol. If one\
      \ imagines that the \"kg\" were replaced by a symbol \"\xDE\", then it is easier\
      \ to conceptualize the multiplier \"m\" as creating the proper unit \"m\xDE\"\
      , and not the forbidden unit \"mkg\"."

  UnitSymbol:
    description: "The derived units defined for usage in the CIM. In some cases, the\
      \ derived unit is equal to an SI unit. Whenever possible, the standard derived\
      \ symbol is used instead of the formula for the derived unit. For example, the\
      \ unit symbol Farad is defined as \"F\" instead of \"CPerV\". In cases where\
      \ a standard symbol does not exist for a derived unit, the formula for the unit\
      \ is used as the unit symbol. For example, density does not have a standard\
      \ symbol and so it is represented as \"kgPerm3\". With the exception of the\
      \ \"kg\", which is an SI unit, the unit symbols do not contain multipliers and\
      \ therefore represent the base derived unit to which a multiplier can be applied\
      \ as a whole. \r\nEvery unit symbol is treated as an unparseable text as if\
      \ it were a single-letter symbol. The meaning of each unit symbol is defined\
      \ by the accompanying descriptive text and not by the text contents of the unit\
      \ symbol.\r\nTo allow the widest possible range of serializations without requiring\
      \ special character handling, several substitutions are made which deviate from\
      \ the format described in IEC 80000-1. The division symbol \"/\" is replaced\
      \ by the letters \"Per\". Exponents are written in plain text after the unit\
      \ as \"m3\" instead of being formatted as \"m\" with a superscript of 3  or\
      \ introducing a symbol as in \"m^3\". The degree symbol \"\xB0\" is replaced\
      \ with the letters \"deg\". Any clarification of the meaning for a substitution\
      \ is included in the description for the unit symbol.\r\nNon-SI units are included\
      \ in list of unit symbols to allow sources of data to be correctly labelled\
      \ with their non-SI units (for example, a GPS sensor that is reporting numbers\
      \ that represent feet instead of meters). This allows software to use the unit\
      \ symbol information correctly convert and scale the raw data of those sources\
      \ into SI-based units. \r\nThe integer values are used for harmonization with\
      \ IEC 61850."
